Solution for Terraform Error: subscription_id is a required provider property
The error indicates that Terraform requires an explicit subscription_id in the provider configuration for Azure Resource Manager (azurerm).

Steps to Fix the Issue
1. Explicitly Set subscription_id in Provider Block
Modify your provider "azurerm" block to explicitly set the subscription_id, using the data.azurerm_subscription.current.id value you are already retrieving.

hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = data.azurerm_subscription.current.subscription_id
}
However, data.azurerm_subscription.current.subscription_id is invalid because the correct field is simply .id. Update it as follows:

hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = data.azurerm_subscription.current.id
}
2. Use Environment Variables for Authentication (Recommended)
Instead of hardcoding the subscription ID, set the following environment variables to ensure Terraform correctly authenticates:

sh
Copy
Edit
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="your-tenant-id"
Then, run Terraform again:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
3. Verify That Authentication Works
To confirm that Terraform is authenticated correctly, try running:

sh
Copy
Edit
az login
az account show
Make sure the correct subscription ID is displayed.

Final Updated Provider Block
hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = data.azurerm_subscription.current.id
}
Why This Works
The subscription_id property is required by Terraform when interacting with Azure.
The data.azurerm_subscription.current.id correctly fetches the current subscription ID dynamically.
Setting environment variables ensures credentials are available without hardcoding.
