Subject: Issue with GitHub Action Workflow Secret â€“ Invalid ARM_CLIENT_ID and ARM_CLIENT_SECRET

Hi Box Core Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out to report an issue I am encountering with my GitHub Action workflow. When I run the workflow, I receive an error stating "Invalid secret: ARM_CLIENT_ID and ARM_CLIENT_SECRET."

I have not made any changes to the workflow configuration, and these secrets were previously working fine. Could you please help me investigate if there are any issues with the repository secrets, permissions, or if any recent changes might have affected their validity?

Let me know if you need any additional details from my end to assist in troubleshooting. I appreciate your support and look forward to your response.

Best regards,
