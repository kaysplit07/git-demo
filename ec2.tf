User Story: Importing Azure VM into Terraform
Title: Import Azure Virtual Machine (VM) into Terraform

As a DevOps Engineer,
I want to import an existing Azure Virtual Machine into Terraform,
so that I can manage the infrastructure as code and track changes to the Azure VM.

Acceptance Criteria:
Azure VM Identification:
The correct Azure VM to be imported must be identified by its unique ID (or name) in the Azure portal.

Terraform Configuration:
A Terraform configuration file (main.tf) should be created to represent the Azure VM resource that will be imported.

Import Command Execution:
The terraform import command must be executed successfully to import the Azure VM into the Terraform state. The command should be in the format:

cpp
Copy
terraform import azurerm_virtual_machine.example <VM_ID>
Validate Import:
Once the import is complete, the Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) must include the Azure VM resource with the correct resource ID.

Resource Configuration:
The imported resource must have its attributes correctly reflected in the Terraform configuration file. If any attributes are missing or incorrect, the configuration should be updated manually to match the actual resource setup in Azure.

Execution Plan:
Running terraform plan should result in no changes being applied to the Azure VM if the configuration file matches the actual state of the resource.

Documentation and Commenting:
The process for importing the Azure VM and any manual steps taken should be documented in the repository, with clear comments within the Terraform configuration file.

Error Handling:
If the import fails (due to missing permissions, incorrect VM ID, or other issues), proper error messages and troubleshooting steps should be provided to resolve the issue.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that the Azure VM's state and any associated resources (network interfaces, disks, etc.) are properly represented in the Terraform configuration.

This user story applies to both Windows and Linux-based VMs on Azure.

The Terraform configuration should be aligned with best practices, such as defining resource groups and appropriate tagging.
