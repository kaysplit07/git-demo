Documentation of Changes: Adding a Second Subnet and Network Interface to a Windows VM
This document outlines the changes made between main.tf and updated-main.tf. The updates were aimed at adding support for a second subnet and an additional network interface (NIC) for a Windows virtual machine.

Key Changes with Line Numbers and Explanations
1. File Header Update
Line 1: Updated file header to indicate the feature branch.
diff
Copy code
- #main.tf
+ #feature branch
2. New Subnet Variable
Line 144: Added a variable for the second subnet (subnetname_wvm2).
diff
Copy code
+      "subnetname_wvm2" = var.subnetname_wvm2,
3. Dynamic Mapping for Second Subnet
Lines 342–347: Added logic to handle the second subnet dynamically.
diff
Copy code
+ subnetname_wvm2 = try(
+   (inst.subnetname_wvm2 == "" ? local.variables_row.subnetname_wvm2 : inst.subnetname_wvm2),
+   local.variables_row.subnetname_wvm2
+ )
4. Updated NIC Naming Convention
Lines 420–421: Adjusted NIC names to support two network interfaces.
diff
Copy code
- nic_name = join("-", [inst.vm_name, "nic"])
+ nic_name_1 = join("-", [inst.vm_name, "nic-01"])
+ nic_name_2 = join("-", [inst.vm_name, "nic-02"])
5. New NIC IDs for Two Interfaces
Lines 434–448: Updated logic to create two NIC IDs (nic_id_1 and nic_id_2).
diff
Copy code
- nic_id = join("/", [local.naming.subscription_id, "resourceGroups", ...])
+ nic_id_1 = join("/", [local.naming.subscription_id, ..., inst.nic_name_1])
+ nic_id_2 = join("/", [local.naming.subscription_id, ..., inst.nic_name_2])
6. Updated Subnet Mapping
Lines 462–475: Added mappings for the second NIC's subnet.
diff
Copy code
+ subnet_nic2_map = {
+   for row_id, inst in data.azurerm_subnet.nic2 : row_id => {
+     nic_subnet_id_2 = inst.id
+     ...
+   }
+ }
7. New Subnet Data Block
Lines 531–537: Introduced a second azurerm_subnet data block for the additional subnet.
diff
Copy code
+ data "azurerm_subnet" "nic2" {
+   name = (each.value).subnetname_wvm2
+   virtual_network_name = (each.value).vnet_name
+   ...
+ }
8. New NIC Resource
Lines 576–590: Added a new azurerm_network_interface resource for the second NIC.
diff
Copy code
+ resource "azurerm_network_interface" "nic2" {
+   name = (each.value).nic_name_2
+   ip_configuration {
+     subnet_id = data.azurerm_subnet.nic2[each.key].id
+     ...
+   }
+ }
9. Updated VM Resource
Lines 681–684: Updated the VM resource to include both NICs in the network_interface_ids.
diff
Copy code
- network_interface_ids = [(each.value).nic_id]
+ network_interface_ids = [(each.value).nic_id_1, (each.value).nic_id_2]
Summary of Changes
File Metadata: Updated header.
Variables: Added support for subnetname_wvm2.
NIC Logic: Updated naming and added logic for multiple NICs.
Subnets: Defined and mapped a second subnet for the new NIC.
VM Configuration: Modified to include both NICs.
