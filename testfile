Comments for Changes in the Code
Below is a detailed list of changes and corresponding comments added to explain the modifications:

File: .github/workflows/Deploy_lb.yml
Replaced "Destroy LB" with "Remove LB":

Reason: Improved clarity and user-friendliness of the workflow option.
yaml
Copy code
- Remove (Destroy LB)
+ Remove
Used secrets: inherit for Terraform:

Reason: Simplifies access to secrets for Terraform processes, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
yaml
Copy code
- ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
- ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
- ...
+ secrets: inherit
Added Input Parameters (subnetname, private_ip_address, etc.):

Reason: Expanded workflow flexibility by allowing users to specify subnet names, private IPs, and NIC details dynamically.
File: Azure/Azure-LB/LB-module/main.tf
Added azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool Resource:

Reason: Enables the association of backend address pools with the load balancer for traffic routing.
hcl
Copy code
resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool" "internal_lb_bepool" {
  for_each        = azurerm_lb.internal_lb
  loadbalancer_id = azurerm_lb.internal_lb[each.key].id
  ...
}
Added Support for NIC Associations with Backend Pools:

Reason: Ensures that the virtual machine NICs are correctly associated with the backend address pool.
hcl
Copy code
resource "azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association" "lb_backend_association" {
  network_interface_id   = data.azurerm_network_interface.nic[each.value].id
  backend_address_pool_id = azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool["1"].id
}
Defined Local Variables for Naming Standards:

Reason: Implements consistent naming conventions across resources to improve readability and standardization.
File: Azure/Azure-LB/variable.tf
Added Variables for Load Balancer Configuration:

Reason: Introduced variables such as lb_rule_tcp_backend_port, lb_rule_https_protocol, and private_ip_address_allocation to parameterize load balancer configurations, enabling flexible and reusable deployments.
Validation Logic for purpose_rg:

Reason: Ensures the purpose_rg field does not exceed character limits and adheres to naming conventions.
hcl
Copy code
validation {
  condition     = strcontains(var.purpose_rg, "-") ? length(var.purpose_rg) <= 80 : length(var.purpose_rg) <= 5
  error_message = "Purpose segment cannot exceed 5 characters. Name cannot exceed 80."
}
File: Azure/windows-vm/main.tf
Added azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_association Resource:

Reason: Connects the Windows VM to the load balancer's backend address pool, enabling load balancing for VM traffic.
hcl
Copy code
resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_association" "VM_to_LB" {
  loadbalancer_backend_address_pool_id = var.loadbalancer_id
}
Introduced random_id for Password Generation:

Reason: Ensures that each deployment generates a unique, secure password dynamically.
File: Azure/windows-vm/outputs.tf
Added Output for NIC IDs:

Reason: Exposes the NIC IDs of deployed VMs for downstream processes or debugging purposes.
hcl
Copy code
output "nic_ids" {
  value = [for nic in azurerm_network_interface.nic : nic.id]
  description = "List of NIC IDs for the deployed VMs."
}
Added Output for Input Validation:

Reason: Provides validation states of input parameters to ensure correctness during deployment.
hcl
Copy code
output "input_validation" {
  value = [for inst in local.validation_map : inst.state]
}
File: Azure/windows-vm/variables.tf
Introduced loadbalancer_id Variable:
Reason: Allows referencing a load balancer's ID dynamically during deployment.
hcl
Copy code
variable "loadbalancer_id" {
  type = string
}
Summary of Changes
Improved workflow user experience by renaming and expanding input parameters.
Enhanced modularity and flexibility with variables for dynamic configuration.
Strengthened integration between VMs and the load balancer with backend pool associations.
Applied consistent naming conventions and added validation logic for input parameters.
Exposed critical outputs for debugging and downstream processing.
