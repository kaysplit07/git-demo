To update the workflow using Solution 3 (environment variables), set environment variables for your Azure backend configuration. Below is a revised approach to initialize Terraform with backend settings passed as environment variables.

Updated Workflow
Step 1: Set Environment Variables
In your terminal, define the necessary environment variables. You can add these to a script or use them directly in your shell session:

bash
Copy code
export ARM_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="your-resource-group-name"
export ARM_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-storage-account-name"
export ARM_CONTAINER_NAME="terraform-state"
export ARM_KEY="resource_type/resource_name.tfstate"
Step 2: Reference Environment Variables in main.tf
Since Terraform backend configurations do not directly support variables, you’ll use environment variables to supply these values. Ensure that main.tf doesn’t define the backend configuration, as it will be sourced from the environment variables.

Step 3: Initialize Terraform with Environment Variables
Run the following Terraform initialization command, which will use the environment variables for backend configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Optional: Automate with a Script
To simplify initialization, you can create a shell script (e.g., init.sh) to set up the environment and initialize Terraform in one step:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Set environment variables for backend configuration
export ARM_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="your-resource-group-name"
export ARM_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-storage-account-name"
export ARM_CONTAINER_NAME="terraform-state"
export ARM_KEY="resource_type/resource_name.tfstate"

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init
Then run the script:

bash
Copy code
./init.sh
Summary
This approach avoids hardcoding sensitive values in your Terraform configuration file and keeps the backend configuration flexible across different environments. The terraform init command will pick up the backend configuration from the environment variables you defined.
