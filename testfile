Might be late to answer this, but here goes. Once you have created LB and VM, you can use this snippet to associate NIC and LB backend pool:

resource "azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association" "vault" {
  network_interface_id    = "${azurerm_network_interface.nic.id}"
  ip_configuration_name   = "nic_ip_config"
  backend_address_pool_id = "${azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.nic.id}"
}
