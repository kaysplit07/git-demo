Step 1: Open Terminal
Press Cmd (âŒ˜) + Space, type Terminal, and press Enter.
Or, open Terminal from Applications â†’ Utilities.
Step 2: Install Xcode Command Line Tools
Before installing Homebrew, you need Xcode Command Line Tools.

Run this command in Terminal:

sh
Copy code
xcode-select --install
Click Install in the pop-up window.
Wait for the installation to finish.
ðŸ‘‰ To check if it's installed, run:

sh
Copy code
xcode-select -p
If it returns a path like /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools, you're good to go!

Step 3: Install Homebrew
Run this command in Terminal:

sh
Copy code
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
This script downloads and installs Homebrew.
Follow the on-screen instructions (it may ask for your password).
Step 4: Add Homebrew to Your PATH
After installation, Homebrew might tell you to add it to your shell configuration.

For zsh (default shell on macOS Catalina and later), run:

sh
Copy code
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
For bash (older macOS versions), run:

sh
Copy code
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
Step 5: Verify the Installation
Check if Homebrew is installed correctly:

sh
Copy code
brew --version
âœ… You should see the version number (e.g., Homebrew 4.0.0).

Step 6: Test Homebrew by Installing a Package
To test, install a simple package like wget:
