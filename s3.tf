Reference to undeclared input variable
The variable vm_names is used in multiple places but is not declared in your Terraform code.

Fix: Declare vm_names in variables.tf
Add a variable declaration for vm_names:

hcl
Copy code
variable "vm_names" {
  description = "List of VM names for NIC configurations"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}
2. Missing resource instance key
This error occurs because azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool uses a for_each loop. You must reference a specific instance.

Fix: Update the backend_address_pool_id Reference
Use the correct instance key:

hcl
Copy code
backend_address_pool_id = azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool[each.key].id
3. Missing resource: azurerm_network_interface
The azurerm_network_interface resource is missing but is referenced in the azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association block.

Fix: Use Data Resource Correctly
If youâ€™re referencing an existing NIC, ensure the azurerm_network_interface data block is correctly defined:

hcl
Copy code
data "azurerm_network_interface" "nic" {
  for_each = toset(var.vm_names)
  name                = join("-", [each.value, "nic-01"])
  resource_group_name = join("-", [local.naming.bu, local.naming.environment, local.env_location.locations_abbreviation, local.purpose, "rg"])
}
Reference the data resource instead of a missing resource:

hcl
Copy code
network_interface_id = data.azurerm_network_interface.nic[each.key].id
4. Missing Instance Key for backend_address_pool_id
The azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool resource is also using for_each, so you need to reference the appropriate instance.

Fix: Add Correct Key Reference
Update:

hcl
Copy code
backend_address_pool_id = azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool.id
To:

hcl
Copy code
backend_address_pool_id = azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool[each.key].id
Corrected Code
Data Block for NIC
hcl
Copy code
data "azurerm_network_interface" "nic" {
  for_each = toset(var.vm_names)
  name                = join("-", [each.value, "nic-01"])
  resource_group_name = join("-", [local.naming.bu, local.naming.environment, local.env_location.locations_abbreviation, local.purpose, "rg"])
}
Backend Association
hcl
Copy code
resource "azurerm_network_interface_backend_address_pool_association" "lb_associations" {
  for_each = toset(var.vm_names)

  network_interface_id    = data.azurerm_network_interface.nic[each.key].id
  backend_address_pool_id = azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.internal_lb_bepool[each.key].id
}
Variable Declaration
hcl
Copy code
variable "vm_names" {
  description = "List of VM names for NIC configurations"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}
Testing Recommendations
Validate Configuration: Run:

bash
Copy code
terraform validate
Plan the Deployment: Run:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan -var="vm_names=['VM1', 'VM2', 'VM3']"
Apply: Ensure everything works by running:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply -auto-approve -var="vm_names=['VM1', 'VM2', 'VM3']"
These fixes address the missing variable declarations, correct instance references for resources using for_each, and properly define the azurerm_network_interface data block. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
