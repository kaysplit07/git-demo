Hi Kayode,

It seems you request was fulfilled today, it was fulfilled by automated task. Please check if you are all set. Not sure why you escalate this ticket to me though?

In the future, hope you will not need this, if your ticket is not progressing, please contact Service Desk via chat or phone and ask Formally escalate ( ticket can be escalated it is> 5 business days since it was opened), this will trigger the engagement of the specific escalation team( depending it is request or incident) and you will get assistance â€“ this is the correct and quickest process ,if there is a delays

Regards,
